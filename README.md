# Course Projects Overview

## Introduction

This repository showcases two projects from CS350 - Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies. These projects demonstrate my ability to design and implement interface software to control hardware components, evaluate hardware architecture designs, and recommend systems based on business requirements.

## Projects Detail

### Milestone Two

**Objective:** Control red LEDs on a microcontroller board via UART commands in a memory-efficient manner.

**Solution:**
- Implemented a state machine that reacts to 'ON' and 'OFF' commands to control the LED status.

### Milestone Three

**Objective:** Implement a pattern of blinking LEDs that represent Morse code messages, changing dynamically upon button presses.

**Solution:**
- Developed a synchronous state machine with timer interrupts to manage Morse code messages displayed via LED blink patterns.

## Reflections on Performance

### Strengths

- **Efficiency in Design:** Demonstrated strong capabilities in designing minimalistic yet effective state machines.
- **Effective Use of Interrupts:** Successfully used hardware interrupts to facilitate time-sensitive operations without continuous monitoring.

### Areas for Improvement

- **User Interface Design:** Future projects should focus on enhancing user interaction elements for better clarity and usability.
- **Testing and Validation:** Implementing a broader range of test scenarios could help in ensuring system performance under varied conditions.

## Tools and Resources Added to Support Network

- **Hardware Simulation Software:** Integration of tools like Proteus for circuit design and microcontroller simulation.
- **Code Repositories and Community Interaction:** Leveraged platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow for code management and community-driven problem solving.

## Transferable Skills

- **State Machine Design:** The ability to efficiently design state machines is applicable in various technological domains.
- **Resource Optimization:** Skills in optimizing applications to operate within constrained environments are essential for developing IoT devices and mobile applications.

## Code Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
